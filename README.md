# Cohesive_Energy
This is a tutorial to run LAMMPS simulation to calculate cohesive energy of nickel using eam potential.


In generation of interatomic potential function, no step describes about the energetically favorable structure of the system. It is necessary to verify the most favorable crystal structure of the system described by the chosen interatomic potential. 

Energies of the Nickel in BCC, FCC, HCP phases with varying lattice constants are calculated to obtain the lowest energy for each phase.
